# Deployment Fix - Lock File Update

## ðŸš¨ Issue Resolved

The deployment error was caused by the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file being out of sync with `package.json` after adding the Google Maps dependency.

## âœ… Solution Applied

1. **Updated Lock File**: Ran `pnpm install` to sync the lock file with package.json
2. **Added Dependency**: Successfully added `@googlemaps/js-api-loader@1.16.10`
3. **Staged Changes**: Added the updated `pnpm-lock.yaml` to git

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps

Run this command to commit the lock file fix:

```bash
git commit -m "fix: Update pnpm-lock.yaml for Google Maps dependency

- Added @googlemaps/js-api-loader@1.16.10 dependency
- Fixed lock file sync issue for deployment
- Resolves ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE error"
```

## ðŸš€ Deployment Ready

After committing the lock file fix, your deployment should work successfully. The error was specifically:

```
ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE  Cannot install with "frozen-lockfile" because pnpm-lock.yaml is not up to date with <ROOT>/package.json
```

This has been resolved by updating the lock file to include the new Google Maps dependency.

## ðŸ“‹ Summary

- âœ… **Lock file updated** with new dependency
- âœ… **Dependency installed** successfully
- âœ… **Changes staged** for commit
- ðŸ”„ **Ready for commit** and deployment

The deployment should now proceed without issues! ðŸŽ¯
